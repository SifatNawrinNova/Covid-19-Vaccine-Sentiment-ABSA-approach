# Covid-19-Vaccine-Sentiment-ABSA-approach

This project aims to analyse public sentiment on COVID-19 vaccinations using
text classification. Through the use of Linear Regression, achieving an AUC score
of 0.921 along with Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) and TF-IDF vectorization, we identified key sentiments,
uncovering both support and discouragement for vaccination. Our findings, derived from well-processed data, serve as
a crucial tool for informing health communication strategies. The insights helped
to observe the potential of analytical models in navigating public health challenges,
guiding future efforts towards enhancing
model precision and broadening the scope
of analysis.
